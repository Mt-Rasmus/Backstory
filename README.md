# Backstory

Backstory is a social game.
It can be played with two or more people.

## How to play:
One person will act as game leader. 
This person selects a story and reads its premise aloud to everyone. 
The game leader then reads the backstory to him-/herself without revealing it to the group. 
The rest of the group then have to ask questions to the game leader in order to figure out what the backstory is. 
They may only ask 'yes' or 'no' questions.
