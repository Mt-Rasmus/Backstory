export default 'This game can be played with two or more people. \
                One person will act as game leader. This person selects a story and reads its premise \
                aloud to everyone (click one of the icons on the Stories page). \
                The game leader then reads the backstory to him-/herself without revealing it to the group \
                (click the button labeled Backstory). \
                The rest of the group then have to ask questions to the game leader \
                in order to figure out what the backstory is. \
                They may only ask \'yes\' or \'no\' questions. \
                The game leader may reply to questions where incorrect assumptions have been made \
                with: \'You\'ve made an incorrect assumption\'. \
                If someone in the group is too scared to play, then please go easy on them. \
                Just take a deep breath and try to understand that everyone may not have been blessed with \
                your level of coolness.'
